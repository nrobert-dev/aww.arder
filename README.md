# Welcome to Aww.arder!ðŸ’¬

Hi! **Aww.arder** is a simple, fun web-app written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) which allows you and your team to offer praise to each other during your regular meetings. Create a team, add members to it and then compliment each other!

**Aww.awarder** was born as the result of a desire to learn more about the Rust and WebAssembly environment. The Rust code is compiled all the way down to wasm, so no JS has been used in making this project!
